Tests:
    "@Test
@When("greeting is done")
@When("uma saudação é feita")
public void greeting_is_done() {
    actual = g.sayHello();
}
"Scenario 1: Verify Correct Greeting Message
Details:
  TestName: verifyCorrectGreetingMessage
  Description: This test verifies that the sayHello method returns the correct greeting message "Hello World!".
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method has no dependencies or data requirements.
  Act: Call the sayHello method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from the sayHello method is "Hello World!".
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the method returns "Hello World!", which is the expected output. This is significant as it confirms that the method is performing its intended functionality of returning the correct greeting message.
Scenario 2: Ensure Method Consistency Over Multiple Calls
Details:
  TestName: ensureMethodConsistencyMultipleCalls
  Description: This test checks that the sayHello method consistently returns the same output on multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method has no state or external dependencies.
  Act: Call the sayHello method multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that all returned values from these multiple calls are identical and equal to "Hello World!".
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that multiple calls to sayHello return the same result, ensuring the method's reliability and idempotency. This is important for confirming that the method does not have hidden states or side effects affecting its output.
Scenario 3: Confirm Non-Null Output
Details:
  TestName: confirmNonNullOutput
  Description: This test ensures that the sayHello method never returns a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no setup required since the method is straightforward and independent.
  Act: Call the sayHello method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for a non-null value, which is crucial to prevent any null pointer exceptions in applications that might use this method without null checks. It assures the robustness of the method in various usage contexts.
Scenario 4: Evaluate Performance Under Load
Details:
  TestName: evaluatePerformanceUnderLoad
  Description: This test evaluates whether the sayHello method maintains its performance under simulated high-load conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate multiple concurrent calls to the sayHello method using a multi-threading approach.
  Act: Measure the time taken for each thread's execution to complete.
  Assert: Assert that each thread completes within an acceptable time frame and all return "Hello World!".
Validation:
  This test is significant for assessing the method's performance and scalability. The assertion ensures that the method can handle a high number of requests without degradation in response times or outputs, which is crucial for high-availability applications.
