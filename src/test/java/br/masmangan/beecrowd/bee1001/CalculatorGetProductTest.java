Scenario 1: Multiplication of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: multiplyTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test checks the multiplication of two positive integers to verify if the product is calculated correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set private fields 'a' and 'b' to positive integers (e.g., 5 and 3).
  Act: Invoke getProduct() to calculate the product of 'a' and 'b'.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 15.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the product of two positive integers is computed correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the multiplication logic correctly handles positive numbers.
Scenario 2: Multiplication of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: multiplyTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test verifies the multiplication result of two negative integers to ensure the product is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set private fields 'a' and 'b' to negative integers (e.g., -4 and -2).
  Act: Invoke getProduct() to calculate the product of 'a' and 'b'.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 8.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the product of two negative integers results in a positive value.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Confirms that the multiplication logic correctly interprets and computes products of negative numbers.
Scenario 3: Multiplication with zero
Details:
  TestName: multiplyWithZero
  Description: This test ensures that any number multiplied by zero results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set private fields 'a' to any integer (e.g., 5) and 'b' to zero.
  Act: Invoke getProduct() to calculate the product of 'a' and 'b'.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that multiplying any number by zero yields zero.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the multiplication logic handles zero correctly, which is a fundamental property of multiplication.
Scenario 4: Multiplication of a positive and a negative number
Details:
  TestName: multiplyPositiveAndNegative
  Description: This test checks the result when a positive integer is multiplied by a negative integer, expecting a negative product.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set private fields 'a' to a positive integer (e.g., 6) and 'b' to a negative integer (e.g., -3).
  Act: Invoke getProduct() to calculate the product of 'a' and 'b'.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to -18.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the product of a positive and a negative integer is negative.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures that the multiplication logic correctly handles scenarios involving both positive and negative numbers.
Scenario 5: Multiplication of large numbers
Details:
  TestName: multiplyLargeNumbers
  Description: This test verifies that the method can handle large integers and compute their product accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set private fields 'a' and 'b' to large integers (e.g., 100000 and 200000).
  Act: Invoke getProduct() to calculate the product of 'a' and 'b'.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 20000000000L.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The assertion checks that the multiplication of large numbers is handled correctly without overflow (assuming the language supports it).
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Validates that the method can be used with large values, which could be critical in high-value computations.
