"Scenario 1: Adding Two Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: addTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly sums two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the fields 'a' and 'b' with positive integers, e.g., a = 5, b = 3.
  Act: Call the getSum() method to compute the sum.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the sum of the two numbers, i.e., assertEquals(8, result).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the addition of two positive numbers is handled correctly. This is significant as it ensures the fundamental arithmetic operation (addition) performs as expected under normal conditions.
Scenario 2: Adding Two Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: addTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test verifies the method's ability to handle the sum of two negative integers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'a' and 'b' with negative integers, e.g., a = -4, b = -6.
  Act: Invoke the getSum() method.
  Assert: Check that the result matches the expected sum, i.e., assertEquals(-10, result).
Validation:
  The assertion checks the correctness of adding two negative numbers. It's crucial for ensuring that the method can handle negative values, which is a common scenario in arithmetic operations.
Scenario 3: Adding a Positive and a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: addPositiveAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test ensures that the method can correctly sum a positive number and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize 'a' as a positive integer and 'b' as a negative integer, e.g., a = 7, b = -2.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result equals the expected sum, i.e., assertEquals(5, result).
Validation:
  The assertion confirms the method's ability to correctly add numbers of different signs. This test is important for verifying that the method handles sign variation correctly, which is essential for accurate arithmetic calculations.
Scenario 4: Adding Zero to a Number
Details:
  TestName: addZeroToANumber
  Description: This scenario tests the method's response when adding zero to another integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'a' to any integer, e.g., a = 5, and 'b' to 0.
  Act: Execute the getSum() method.
  Assert: Validate that the result is the same as the non-zero integer, i.e., assertEquals(5, result).
Validation:
  The assertion checks that adding zero does not alter the value of the other integer. This scenario is vital for confirming that the method adheres to the identity property of addition.
Scenario 5: Initialization with Default Values
Details:
  TestName: addUninitializedIntegers
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior when both integers are uninitialized and default to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not explicitly set 'a' and 'b', allowing them to take default values (0 in Java for uninitialized int fields).
  Act: Invoke the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0, i.e., assertEquals(0, result).
Validation:
  This test verifies that the default behavior of uninitialized integers (assuming default class instantiation) results in a correct sum of zero. It's essential for understanding how the method behaves with default inputs.
