Scenario 1: Setting a positive integer value for b
Details:
  TestName: setPositiveIntegerForB
  Description: This test verifies that the method setB correctly assigns a positive integer value to the private field b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class containing the setB method.
  Act: Call the setB method with a positive integer value, for example, setB(5).
  Assert: Assert that the field b is updated to the value 5.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test confirms that the setter method correctly updates the field with valid positive integers. It's significant as it ensures the basic functionality of data encapsulation and integrity within the object.
Scenario 2: Setting a negative integer value for b
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeIntegerForB
  Description: This test checks whether the setB method can handle and correctly assign a negative integer value to the field b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke setB with a negative integer, such as setB(-10).
  Assert: Verify that the field b is appropriately set to -10.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This scenario tests the setter's ability to handle negative values, which is crucial for applications that might require such values to be stored in the object.
Scenario 3: Setting zero as the value for b
Details:
  TestName: setZeroForB
  Description: This test ensures that the method setB can set the field b to zero and handle edge cases involving zero values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the class instance.
  Act: Call setB(0).
  Assert: Check that b is set to 0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. Testing with zero is essential as it often represents boundary conditions in logic, ensuring that such edge cases are managed correctly by the method.
Scenario 4: Repeatedly setting values to b
Details:
  TestName: setMultipleValuesForB
  Description: This test checks if calling setB multiple times with different values correctly updates b each time without residual effects from previous invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the class.
  Act: Call setB with different values sequentially, e.g., setB(1), setB(2), and setB(3).
  Assert: Assert that b's value is the last value set, in this case, 3.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test ensures that the setter method updates the state of the object as expected, without unintended caching or errors from prior states.
