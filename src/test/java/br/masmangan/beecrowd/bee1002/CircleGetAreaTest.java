"Scenario 1: Positive Radius Value
Details:
  TestName: calculateAreaWithPositiveRadius
  Description: This test checks the area calculation when a positive value is assigned to the radius. It verifies that the method correctly computes the area of the circle using the formula PI * radius * radius.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the circle to a positive double value (e.g., 5.0).
  Act: Call the getArea() method to compute the area.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is equal to PI multiplied by the square of the radius (78.53975 for radius 5.0).
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method accurately calculates the area for a positive radius, which is crucial for any geometric computations involving circles. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula for the area of a circle.
Scenario 2: Zero Radius
Details:
  TestName: calculateAreaWithZeroRadius
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the area calculation when the radius is zero. It is important to ensure that the method handles this boundary condition correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius of the circle to 0.
  Act: Call the getArea() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the area calculation correctly handles the case where the radius is zero, returning an area of 0. This test is significant as it checks the method's accuracy at the boundary condition of zero radius.
Scenario 3: Negative Radius Value
Details:
  TestName: calculateAreaWithNegativeRadius
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the area calculation method when a negative radius is used. It is crucial to test how the method handles negative inputs, even though geometrically, a negative radius doesn't make sense.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius to a negative value (e.g., -5.0).
  Act: Call the getArea() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is equal to PI multiplied by the square of the radius (78.53975 for radius -5.0, because the square of -5.0 is 25.0).
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method computes the area correctly even for negative radius values by squaring the radius, resulting in a positive area. This test is important to verify that the method accurately handles unexpected or unconventional input values.
Scenario 4: Large Radius Value
Details:
  TestName: calculateAreaWithLargeRadius
  Description: This test evaluates the area calculation method's performance and correctness with a very large radius value. It tests the method's ability to handle large numbers without overflow or precision errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the radius to a very large value (e.g., 1e6).
  Act: Call the getArea() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned area is equal to PI multiplied by the square of the radius (3.14159e12 for radius 1e6).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getArea() method can accurately compute the area for large radius values, which is essential for applications that might deal with large-scale geometric calculations. The expected result is based on the standard area calculation formula.
