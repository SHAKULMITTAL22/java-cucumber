"Scenario 1: Set a Positive Radius
Details:
  TestName: setPositiveRadius
  Description: This test verifies that the setRadius method correctly sets the radius when provided with a positive double value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the setRadius method.
  Act: Call the setRadius method with a positive double value (e.g., 5.0).
  Assert: Confirm that the radius field is updated to the new positive value.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the radius field holds the value 5.0 after the method call. This is crucial as it confirms that the method correctly handles positive inputs and updates the object's state accordingly.
Scenario 2: Set a Negative Radius
Details:
  TestName: setNegativeRadius
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setRadius method when a negative value is passed. It's important to see if the class handles or restricts negative values for radius.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call the setRadius method with a negative double value (e.g., -3.0).
  Assert: Check whether the radius is set to the negative value or if any validation prevents it.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies whether the radius field holds the value -3.0 or not. This test is significant to ensure the methodâ€™s resilience against potentially invalid or undesirable inputs.
Scenario 3: Set Radius to Zero
Details:
  TestName: setRadiusToZero
  Description: Evaluates how the setRadius method handles a radius of zero, which is a boundary condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call the setRadius method with 0 as the value.
  Assert: Ensure that the radius field is set to 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the radius is exactly 0 after method execution. This test is important for boundary testing and to confirm that zero, a valid mathematical value for radius, is handled correctly.
Scenario 4: Set a Very Large Radius
Details:
  TestName: setVeryLargeRadius
  Description: This scenario tests the setRadius method's ability to handle very large values without overflow or errors, ensuring robustness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call the setRadius method with a very large double value (e.g., Double.MAX_VALUE).
  Assert: Verify that the radius field is set to Double.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that the radius can hold the largest possible double value, which is critical for ensuring the method can handle extreme cases without failure.
Scenario 5: Set a Very Small Positive Radius
Details:
  TestName: setVerySmallPositiveRadius
  Description: Tests the setRadius method with a very small positive value close to zero but not zero, to check precision handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class.
  Act: Call the setRadius method with a very small positive double value (e.g., Double.MIN_VALUE).
  Assert: Confirm that the radius field is updated to Double.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the radius is set to the smallest positive double value, testing the method's precision and correctness in handling small numerical values.
