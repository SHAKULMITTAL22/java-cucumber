Scenario 1: Zero Values Test
Details:
  TestName: calculateAverageWithZeroValues
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getAverage method when both input values a and b are zero. It is important to ascertain that the method can handle zero inputs and return a correct average calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 0.0 and b = 0.0.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getAverage is 0.0.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the method correctly computes the average as zero when both inputs are zero. The expected result is zero since the weighted sum of zeros divided by any non-zero number is zero.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that zero inputs do not lead to unexpected results or errors is fundamental for the reliability of the method.
Scenario 2: Positive Values Test
Details:
  TestName: calculateAverageWithPositiveValues
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the getAverage method when both input values a and b are positive. It ensures that the method correctly computes the weighted average of positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 3.0 and b = 5.0.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getAverage is correctly calculated.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test confirms that the method computes the correct weighted average when both inputs are positive. The expected result is calculated as (3.0 * 3.5 + 5.0 * 7.5) / 11.0.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Verifying correct calculations with positive numbers is crucial since it represents a common and realistic scenario for the method's usage.
Scenario 3: Negative Values Test
Details:
  TestName: calculateAverageWithNegativeValues
  Description: This test evaluates the getAverage method when both input values a and b are negative. It is important to ensure that the method correctly handles negative inputs and computes the average accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -3.0 and b = -5.0.
  Act: Invoke the getAveragemethod.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getAverage is correctly calculated.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the method accurately computes the weighted average with negative inputs. The expected result is calculated as (-3.0 * 3.5 + -5.0 * 7.5) / 11.0.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Testing with negative values ensures that the method is robust and can handle different types of numerical input correctly.
Scenario 4: Mixed Sign Values Test
Details:
  TestName: calculateAverageWithMixedSignValues
  Description: This test evaluates the getAverage method when input values a and b have mixed signs (one positive, one negative). It checks the method's ability to compute the average accurately under such conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -3.0 and b = 5.0.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Assert that the result of getAverage is correctly calculated.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the method can accurately compute the weighted average when inputs have mixed signs. The expected result is calculated as (-3.0 * 3.5 + 5.0 * 7.5) / 11.0.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Handling inputs with mixed signs correctly is essential for the method to be reliable and versatile in different computational scenarios.
