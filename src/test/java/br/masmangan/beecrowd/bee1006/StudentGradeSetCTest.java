"Scenario 1: Assign a Positive Decimal Value to c
Details:
  TestName: assignPositiveDecimalToC
  Description: This test checks if the setC method correctly assigns a positive decimal value to the private field 'c'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Call setC with a positive decimal value, e.g., 3.14159.
  Assert: Assert that the field 'c' has been updated to the value 3.14159.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the field 'c' holds the exact positive decimal value passed to setC. This is crucial for ensuring that the class correctly handles positive decimal assignments, which might be common in calculations or operations involving the object.
Scenario 2: Assign a Negative Decimal Value to c
Details:
  TestName: assignNegativeDecimalToC
  Description: This test checks if the setC method correctly assigns a negative decimal value to the private field 'c'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Call setC with a negative decimal value, e.g., -2.71828.
  Assert: Assert that the field 'c' has been updated to the value -2.71828.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the field 'c' holds the exact negative decimal value passed to setC. This test is significant for ensuring that the class can handle negative values, which are often required in various computational scenarios.
Scenario 3: Assign Zero to c
Details:
  TestName: assignZeroToC
  Description: This test checks if the setC method correctly assigns zero to the private field 'c'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Call setC with zero.
  Assert: Assert that the field 'c' has been updated to zero.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the field 'c' holds the value zero after the method call. Testing with zero is essential as it often represents a default or neutral state in many computations.
Scenario 4: Assign Maximum Double Value to c
Details:
  TestName: assignMaxDoubleToC
  Description: This test checks if the setC method correctly assigns the maximum double value to the private field 'c'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Call setC with Double.MAX_VALUE.
  Assert: Assert that the field 'c' has been updated to Double.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the field 'c' can hold the maximum double value. This test is crucial for ensuring that the class can handle extreme positive double values without errors or data loss.
Scenario 5: Assign Minimum Double Value to c
Details:
  TestName: assignMinDoubleToC
  Description: This test checks if the setC method correctly assigns the minimum double value to the private field 'c'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Call setC with Double.MIN_VALUE.
  Assert: Assert that the field 'c' has been updated to Double.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the field 'c' can hold the minimum double value. This test is important for ensuring that the class can handle extreme negative double values and operates correctly under such conditions.
These scenarios comprehensively test the functionality of the setC method across a variety of inputs, ensuring robustness and correctness in the class's handling of its internal state.
