"Scenario 1: Normal Values for All Variables
Details:
  TestName: differenceWithNormalValues
  Description: Test the method with normal integer values for a, b, c, and d to ensure the calculation is performed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 5, b = 10, c = 3, d = 2.
  Act: Call getDifference() to calculate the result.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 40.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the correct computation of the expression (5*10 - 3*2 = 50 - 6 = 44).
  The significance of this test is to confirm that the method handles typical input values correctly and computes the expected result.
Scenario 2: Zero Values
Details:
  TestName: differenceWithZeros
  Description: Test the method when all input variables a, b, c, and d are zero, ensuring that the method handles zero correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0.
  Act: Call getDifference() to calculate the result.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the mathematical property where multiplying zero with any number results in zero, and thus the difference should also be zero.
  This test is significant as it checks the method's behavior with the minimal boundary values and ensures no errors in such cases.
Scenario 3: Negative Values
Details:
  TestName: differenceWithNegativeValues
  Description: Test the method with negative integers to check if the calculation correctly handles negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -5, b = 10, c = -3, d = 2.
  Act: Call getDifference() to calculate the result.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to -50.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks whether the method correctly computes expressions involving negative values (-5*10 - (-3*2) = -50 - (-6) = -50 + 6 = -44).
  This test is significant as it ensures the method correctly handles negative values, which is crucial for accurate calculations in real-world scenarios.
Scenario 4: Large Values
Details:
  TestName: differenceWithLargeValues
  Description: Test the method using very large integers to ensure there are no overflow errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = Integer.MAX_VALUE, b = 1, c = Integer.MAX_VALUE, d = 1.
  Act: Call getDifference() to calculate the result.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies that the method can handle integer boundary values without causing overflow errors.
  This test is critical to ensure that the method is robust and can handle extreme values, which might be common in certain applications.
Scenario 5: Mixed Sign Values
Details:
  TestName: differenceWithMixedSigns
  Description: Test the method with a mix of positive and negative values to ensure mixed sign operations are handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -5, b = 10, c = 3, d = -2.
  Act: Call getDifference() to calculate the result.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to -56.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion checks for correct computation when operands have mixed signs, ensuring accuracy in such situations (-5*10 - 3*(-2) = -50 - (-6) = -50 + 6 = -44).
  The significance of this test is to verify the method's capability to handle mixed signs in operands, which is essential for correct mathematical operations.
